# Infinite Scroll / Lazy loading
I have developed a compact application with the intersection observer api to create an effective lazy loading implementation.

## Technologies

- Javascript
- React
- CSS
- HTML
- Intersection Observer API
- dummyJSON API

## Key Highlights
- I have leveraged the Intersection Observer API to implement a seamless lazy loading feature. This technique optimizes web page performance by loading images and content only when they come into view, reducing initial page load time.
